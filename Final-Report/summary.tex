Other Solutions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sum of sines
    \item Gerstner waves
    \item Particle based ocean simulation
\end{itemize}

Problems:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Computaiontally expensive to calculate huge amouts of sins.
    \item Gerstner waves are not physically accurate.
    \item Both are not easily modifiable.
    \item Does not look good with stormy weather.
    \item Tiling is noticable.
    \item Lacks water detail.
\end{itemize}

Problems I intend to solve:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Simulate water based on emipirical data for a more realistic look.
    \item Have an easy modifiable ocean system.
    \item Have an ocean that can simulate stormy weather.
    \item Reduce tiling.
    \item Have a more detailed ocean.
\end{itemize}

Main achivements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Calculate on GPU.
    \item Implement JONSWAP spectrum.
    \item Implement FFT algorithm.
    \item Simulate foam.
    \item Shade the ocean.
\end{itemize}
