\section{Ideas for future work}
This technique produces realistic oceans in a cost-efficient way suitable for real-time rendering. However, it does not support interactive waves. For that, J. Tessendorf proposed a method called “iWaves” \cite{tessendorf2004} and a later upgraded version “eWaves” \cite{tessendorf2014}.
